 On mondays, I have three classes. A lecture at 2:10, a recitation at 4:00, and a studio class at 7:00. Most of the classes I chose were specifically chosen
 in order to have them be close together, as in my first semester, I had a four hour gap between two of my classes, and due to commuting, it didn't warrent my
 going home. Normally, after the recitation, I go eat lunch/dinner and just work on classwork until my next class.

 On Tuesdays, I only have one class at 7:00. It's truly a mystery as to what class this could be. Most of my day is spent by me sitting on calls with either my
 friends or my girlfriend, before I start doing homework, or catching up on missed work. I then prepare as I explained in the earlier entry, before leaving to
 get to class on time.

 On Wednesday, my plans of having classes stick together falls completely apart, as I have a lecture at 12:20, with my next class coming at around 7:00. As of right now,
 I tend to go home during that large period, and again catch up on homework, and work, and also eat lunch. And then I leave at around 6:00 to make it to class
 on time.

On Thursdays, I go to one class. A discussion class at 12:20. It's rather short, only coming at around an hour.

On Fridays, I again only have one class, that being a seminar class that generally only goes for 3 hours, but that tends to depend on the amount of stuff that people share.
