<h1>Breakfast (Maybe) and Out of the House</h1>

 The next thing most people do, or at least I do, is brush my teeth. Now, I know that some people like to brush their teeth after eating breakfast, but for me?
 I just brush my teeth before anything. As you can see by the title, I don't exactly always eat breakfast, but I know some people do. So after I would do all 
 that, I pack my laptop and everything else I need into my bag, before I change my clothes and get ready to go to school.

 For me, I need to leave for school about thirty minutes to an hour before class, since I commute. Granted, ninety percent of the time I end up to class 
 late, but that's neither here nor there. I walk down the stairs, open the front door and lock it behind me. I then walk past the high school that's right
 by where I live and I walk down to the subway to take my train.
