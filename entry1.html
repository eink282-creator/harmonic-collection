<h1>Morning Laziness</h1>

 The most difficult thing in the day is fighting the urge to lay in bed for just a few more hours when it's time to wake up.
 Nothing would be better than just to continue to lie under the covers rather than having to leave the comfort of sleep
 and moving on with the rest of your day.
    As of late, I myself have been waking up bright and early at 7 o'clock in the morning, only to succumb to this urge to lie
    in bed. Unless I have class, obviously, so thank god I only have one 9 AM class, and I can continue to sleep for a few more hours
    until I actually have to start my day.
